# Operating-Platforms
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  The Gaming Room currently has a game called Draw it or Lose it for Android. They want to improve the software functionality to expand to other platforms. I made sure the document was clear and coise to not give anything confusing. 
  
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  When working through the code I found it helpful to go through sections of the desgin document and work slowly on each one of those sections. I would spend time on each and if one was too much I would come back to the next one the next day.
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  The development requirements was the hardest section for me to acutally write. I understand the requirements but could not fit it all in the little boxes we wre given without creating a huge section.
  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  I took the already developed game and what the company wanted and implented that into my design. This was helpful for developing the code as some of basi ideas of the game was already set forward and the rest was just making sure the companies needs were met. 
  
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  I approached designing software kinda slow. I took it a little bit at a time and when I got stuck I would leave it for a day and come back fresh tomorrow. If I was still stuck from there I looked back from what I knew and used any online resource I had available to try to help me through my stuck spot. In the future I think I will still go a little at a time and try not to overload myself while using old code as refrence for new code.
